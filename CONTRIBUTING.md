# Contributing to Invoice Reconciliation Application

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `development`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production branch. Protected and requires pull request reviews.
- `development` - Main development branch. All feature branches should be created from here.
- `feature/*` - For new features (e.g., `feature/invoice-filtering`)
- `bugfix/*` - For bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/login-error`)
- `hotfix/*` - For urgent fixes to production

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
2. Update the package.json version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
3. The PR must be approved by at least one other developer
4. PRs can only be merged once they have the required approvals and pass all automated checks

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/davidwilliams1601/reconciler-march/issues)

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
